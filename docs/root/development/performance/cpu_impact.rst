Analysis of CPU impact
======================

Experimentation method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

iOS

* TODO

Android
-------

We're currently using HttpURLConnection to communicate and send requests to Envoy. Envoy in it's current state is run as
a process

Getting the build:

1. Build the library using ``bazel build android_dist --config=android``
2. Control: ``bazel mobile-install //examples/kotlin/control:hello_control_kt``
3. Envoy: ``bazel mobile-install //examples/kotlin/hello_world:hello_envoy_kt --fat_apk_cpu=armeabi-v7a``

Experiment steps:

1. Run ``adb shell top -H | grep envoy`` to get the CPU usage of the application (the ``-H`` flag displays the running threads)
2. Wait 10minutes to gather a sample set of data to analyze
3. Take the average CPU% and MEM%

Results

Envoy:

- Avg CPU: 15.67560976%
- Avg MEM: 2.696341463%

Control:

- Avg CPU: 11.27439024%
- Avg MEM: 2.152439024%

Analysis

-------

The results of this experiment is that there is minimal difference between Envoy and Control. By enabling trace logging
within Envoy, we are able to observe the following:

1. Requests to s3 are being logged in Envoy
2. DNS resolution does happen every 5 seconds
3. Stats are flushed every 5 seconds
