Currently supported features
============================

.. attention::

  Envoy Mobile is currently in a very early stage of development. This page will be updated as
  new features are added, and eventually split out into proper documentation. Our initial milestones
  can be `viewed in GitHub <https://github.com/lyft/envoy-mobile/milestones>`_.

* Ability to compile Envoy on both Android and iOS.
* Ability to run Envoy on a thread within an application, utilizing it effectively as an in-process
  proxy server.
* Swift/Obj-C/Kotlin demo applications that utilize exposed Swift/Obj-C/Kotlin "raw" APIs to
  interact with Envoy and make network calls.
