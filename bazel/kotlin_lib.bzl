# Android library drops exported dependencies from dependent rules. The kt_android_library
#  internally is just a macro which wraps two rules into one:
#  https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_kotlin/blob/326661e7e705d14e754abc2765837aa61bddf205/kotlin/internal/jvm/android.bzl#L28.
#  This causes the sources to be exported and dropped due to it being a transitive dependency.
#  To get around this, we have to redeclare the sources from envoy_engine_lib here in order to be pulled into the
#  kotlin jar.
