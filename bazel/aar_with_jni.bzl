# android_library's implicit aar doesn't flatten its transitive
# dependencies. When using the kotlin rules, the kt_android_library rule
# creates a few underlying libraries, because of this the classes.jar in
# the aar we built was empty. This rule separately builds the underlying
# kt.jar file, and replaces the aar's classes.jar with the kotlin jar
